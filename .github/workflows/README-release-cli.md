# Release CLI Workflow Documentation

## Overview

The `release-cli.yml` workflow automatically builds and publishes the SPNL CLI binary for multiple platforms when a GitHub release is published.

## Supported Platforms

The workflow builds binaries for **8 platform configurations**:

### Linux (4 builds)
- **x86_64 GNU** - Dynamic linking with glibc (most common)
- **ARM64 GNU** - Dynamic linking with glibc (for ARM servers)
- **x86_64 musl** - Static binary (portable, works on any Linux distro)
- **ARM64 musl** - Static binary (portable ARM build)

### macOS (2 builds)
- **x86_64** - Intel Macs
- **ARM64** - Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)

### Windows (2 builds)
- **x86_64** - 64-bit Windows (Intel/AMD)
- **ARM64** - 64-bit Windows on ARM (Surface Pro X, etc.)

## Trigger

The workflow runs automatically when you **publish a GitHub release**:

1. Go to your repository's Releases page
2. Click "Draft a new release"
3. Create a tag (e.g., `v0.13.0`)
4. Fill in release title and description
5. Click "Publish release"

The workflow will start immediately and build all platform binaries.

## Output Artifacts

After the workflow completes, the following files will be attached to your release:

```
spnl-v0.13.0-linux-x86_64-gnu.tar.gz       # Linux x86_64 (glibc)
spnl-v0.13.0-linux-x86_64-musl.tar.gz      # Linux x86_64 (static)
spnl-v0.13.0-linux-aarch64-gnu.tar.gz      # Linux ARM64 (glibc)
spnl-v0.13.0-linux-aarch64-musl.tar.gz     # Linux ARM64 (static)
spnl-v0.13.0-macos-x86_64.tar.gz           # macOS Intel
spnl-v0.13.0-macos-aarch64.tar.gz          # macOS Apple Silicon
spnl-v0.13.0-windows-x86_64.zip            # Windows x86_64
spnl-v0.13.0-windows-aarch64.zip           # Windows ARM64
checksums.txt                               # SHA256 checksums for all files
```

## Build Features

Each binary is built with the following Cargo features enabled:
- `rag` - RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) support
- `vllm` - vLLM integration
- `spnl-api` - SPNL API support

**Note**: The `openssl-vendored` feature (statically linked OpenSSL) is only used for musl builds to create fully static binaries. All other platforms (GNU Linux, macOS, Windows) use system OpenSSL for faster builds and smaller binaries.

## Architecture

### Three-Job Design

1. **build-and-upload** (parallel matrix job)
   - Builds binaries for GNU libc, macOS, and Windows platforms in parallel
   - Creates compressed archives (.tar.gz or .zip)
   - Generates SHA256 checksums
   - Uploads artifacts to GitHub Actions

2. **build-musl** (parallel containerized job)
   - Builds static musl binaries using Docker containers
   - Runs in isolated Alpine Linux and cross-compilation containers
   - Creates compressed archives (.tar.gz)
   - Generates SHA256 checksums
   - Uploads artifacts to GitHub Actions

3. **upload-to-release** (sequential job)
   - Downloads all build artifacts from both build jobs
   - Creates combined checksums.txt file
   - Uploads all files to the GitHub release

### Build Methods

- **Native builds**: Used for GNU libc, macOS, and Windows platforms (faster)
- **Containerized builds**: Used for musl builds via Docker containers
  - `rust:alpine` for x86_64-unknown-linux-musl (on ubuntu-latest)
  - `rust:alpine` for aarch64-unknown-linux-musl (on ubuntu-24.04-arm native ARM64 runner)

## GNU vs musl Builds

### GNU libc builds (dynamic)
- **Pros**: Smaller file size, faster build time
- **Cons**: Requires compatible glibc version on target system
- **Use case**: Standard Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, etc.)
- **Build method**: Native compilation on GitHub-hosted runners

### musl builds (static)
- **Pros**: Fully portable, works on any Linux distro, no dependencies
- **Cons**: Slightly larger file size, longer build time
- **Use case**: Alpine Linux, containers, embedded systems, maximum portability
- **Build method**: Containerized builds using Alpine Linux and cross-compilation images

## Debugging

To test the workflow without creating a release:

1. Uncomment the `pull_request` trigger in the workflow file:
   ```yaml
   on:
     release:
       types: [published]
     pull_request:  # Uncomment these lines
       branches: [ main ]
   ```

2. Create a pull request to trigger the workflow
3. The workflow will build all binaries but won't upload to a release

## Customization

### Adding a New Platform

To add support for a new platform, add an entry to the `matrix.platform` array:

```yaml
- runner: ubuntu-latest
  target: new-target-triple
  platform: platform-name
  arch: architecture
  libc: gnu-or-musl-or-empty
  name: Display Name
  use_cross: true-or-false
```

### Changing Build Features

Modify the `cargo build` command in the workflow:

```yaml
cargo build --features your,features,here --release --package spnl-cli --target $TARGET
```

### Adjusting Compression

- Unix archives use `tar czf` (gzip compression)
- Windows archives use `7z a` (zip format)

To change compression level or format, modify the "Prepare binary" steps.

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

1. **Protobuf errors**: Ensure protoc is properly installed for the platform
2. **OpenSSL errors**:
   - For musl builds: The `openssl-vendored` feature builds OpenSSL from source
   - For other platforms: Ensure system OpenSSL is available (usually pre-installed)
3. **Container errors**: Check Docker container availability and compatibility
4. **musl build errors**: Verify Alpine packages (including perl and make for OpenSSL) are correctly installed in containers

### Upload Failures

1. **Permission errors**: Ensure the workflow has `contents: write` permission
2. **Release not found**: Verify the release was published (not draft)
3. **File conflicts**: The workflow uses `--clobber` to overwrite existing files

## Performance

- **Parallel builds**: All 8 platforms build simultaneously
- **Build time**: ~10-20 minutes total (depending on GitHub Actions queue)
- **Caching**: Rust toolchain and dependencies are cached between runs

## Security

- **Checksums**: SHA256 checksums are generated for all binaries
- **Verification**: Users can verify downloads using the checksums.txt file
- **Static linking**: musl builds have no external dependencies
- **macOS Code Signing**: macOS binaries are signed with Apple Developer certificate (optional)
- **macOS Notarization**: macOS binaries are notarized by Apple for Gatekeeper compatibility (optional)

### Optional: macOS Code Signing

**Note**: macOS code signing and notarization are **optional**. The workflow will build unsigned macOS binaries if the secrets are not configured. Unsigned binaries will work but may show Gatekeeper warnings to users.

To enable macOS code signing and notarization, configure these repository secrets:

| Secret Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` | Base64-encoded .p12 certificate file |
| `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for the .p12 certificate |
| `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` | Password for temporary CI keychain (generate any secure random string) |
| `APPLE_ID` | Your Apple ID email |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | Your Apple Developer Team ID |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | App-specific password for notarization |

**Note**: `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` is NOT your Mac's keychain password. It's a password you create specifically for the temporary keychain that GitHub Actions creates during the build. You can generate any secure random string (e.g., using `openssl rand -base64 32`).

#### Setting Up Apple Secrets

1. **Export Certificate**:
   ```bash
   # Export from Keychain Access as .p12 file
   # Then encode to base64:
   base64 -i YourCertificate.p12 | pbcopy
   # Paste into APPLE_CERTIFICATE secret
   ```

2. **Get Team ID**:
   - Visit https://developer.apple.com/account
   - Find your Team ID in Membership section

3. **Create App-Specific Password**:
   - Visit https://appleid.apple.com
   - Sign in and go to Security section
   - Generate app-specific password for notarization

## Example Usage

After the workflow completes, users can download and install:

sudo mv spnl /usr/local/bin/
```

### Linux (musl - static)
