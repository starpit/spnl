# Span Queries: the SQL for GenAI

:rocket: [Playground](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cloud-computer/spnl/?qv=false) **|** [Research Poster](./docs/poster-20250529.pdf) **|** [About Span Queries](./docs/about.md) **|** [Contribute](./docs/dev.md)

What if we had a **SQL for GenAI**? A [Span Query](./docs/about.md) is
a declarative description of how to link together data into a
[map/reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce) tree of one or
more generation calls. For example, in a RAG scenario, a span query
allows you to express that the relevant document fragments are
independent of each other. The goals of this work are to:

- improve cache locality and reduce inference latency for deep
  research (c.f. [block attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409)).
- provide a generalized inference scaling strategy using the power of map/reduce.
- facilitate [query planning](./docs/query-planning.md) to improve
  both outcomes and request routing.
- as with SQL, allow for a clean separation of concerns between
  conventional programming logic and backend interactions.

> [!NOTE]
> Plans are underway for integration with model serving backends (stay tuned!) and with user-facing libraries such as [PDL](https://github.com/IBM/prompt-declaration-language). Please open an issue documenting your use cases!

## Getting Started

To kick the tires, you can use the [online
playground](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cloud-computer/spnl/?qv=false),
or the Span Query CLI. The playground will let you run queries
directly in browsers that support
[WebGPU](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API)
(albeit slowly).  The CLI can leverage local
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/) or any OpenAI-compatible model server
(e.g. [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)). The CLI is
currently geared towards demos. Using it, you can run one of the
built-in demos, or you can point it to a JSON file containing a span
query.

### Setting up the Span Query CLI

The span query system is written in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). This choice was made to facilitate
flexible integration with backends, CLIs, and with Python
libraries. Plus, Rust is awesome. Thus, step 1 in getting started with
the CLI is to [configure your
environment](./https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for
Rust.. Step 2 is to clone this repository. Now you can run a quick
demo with:

```shell
cargo run
```

The full usage is provided via `cargo run -- --help`, which also
specifies the available demos.

```bash
Usage: spnl [OPTIONS] [FILE]

Arguments:
  [FILE]  File to process
